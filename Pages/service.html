        <p>Project duration depends on several factors including the number of features, design complexity, content readiness, and client responsiveness. A basic website might take 2–3 weeks, while a custom app or branding package could extend to 6–8 weeks. We follow a structured workflow: discovery, planning, design, development, testing, and launch. Each phase includes checkpoints for feedback and adjustments. We also offer accelerated timelines for urgent projects, provided the scope is clearly defined and assets are ready.</p>
