      <p>
        Hi, my name is Randima Ndivho, and I am the founder of Valid MultiGroup. This is the story of how a simple idea turned into a company with a vision to inspire, innovate, and create impact. I was born a natural creative, not necessarily the smartest at school, but always curious and driven by whatever my mind could imagine. From a young age, I loved experimenting, building ideas in my head, and bringing them to life in any way I could.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valid MultiGroup started as an idea called Randima MultiGroup, but as I reflected on what the company could become, I realized I wanted a name that would resonate with everyone and feel universally inspiring. After much thought and exploration, the name Valid MultiGroup was born. “Valid” reflects the core belief of this company — that anything is possible if you have the vision, creativity, and courage to pursue it. If you have a goal, a dream, or an idea, you are valid to chase it and make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in a family of six, with four siblings, I learned the importance of collaboration, resilience, and thinking outside the box. These lessons have shaped the foundation of Valid MultiGroup. Every project we take on, whether in technology, media, design, or business, carries the spirit of innovation, creativity, and problem-solving that I’ve nurtured since childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Valid MultiGroup, we believe that creativity without purpose isn’t enough. Every solution we craft, every design we create, and every strategy we develop is meant to solve real problems and open doors for our clients. We approach each project with curiosity, dedication, and the mindset that there is always a better way to do things. This culture of exploration, learning, and bold experimentation is what sets us apart and drives the results we deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valid MultiGroup is more than just a company — it’s a reflection of my mindset and values. We don’t just create services; we create opportunities, solutions, and experiences that empower businesses and individuals alike. Every website, app, design, and strategy we deliver is crafted with thought, care, and the belief that what we build can change the game for our clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey is just beginning. From the first spark of an idea in a young boy’s mind to the multi-industry solutions we offer today, Valid MultiGroup stands as a testament to creativity, persistence, and the courage to innovate. We are committed to growing, learning, and constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. This is not just my story — it’s the story of every dreamer, every creator, and everyone who dares to think bigger. At Valid MultiGroup, we are here to turn ideas into reality, one bold step at a time.
