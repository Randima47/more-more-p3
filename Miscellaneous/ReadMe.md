# Valid MultiGroup Website – Final Submission (Part 3)
Crafted by **Randima Ndivho**, this website is the culmination of a multi-phase development journey, from a concept to polished execution. It reflects not just technical skill, but vision, branding, accessibility, and storytelling. Valid MultiGroup is more than a company, it’s a mindset. This site proves it.

## Brand Philosophy
“If you have a goal, a dream, or an idea — you are valid to chase it and make it happen.”
Valid MultiGroup began as Randima MultiGroup — a personal spark. It evolved into a universal brand built on creativity, resilience, and purpose. This site embodies that transformation,
 offering services in:
- Web Development  
- App Development  
- Brand Strategy  
- Content Creation
It also includes a personal story, interactive booking, and full SEO-ready infrastructure.

## Project Goals
- Deliver a fully responsive, accessible, and branded website  
- Showcase multi-industry services with clarity and interactivity  
- Implement advanced form validation and user feedback  
- Optimize for SEO, performance, and discoverability  
- Reflect the founder’s journey and values through design and content

## How to Run Locally

2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
3. Make sure the following folders are present:
   - `Css/` → contains `style.css`
   - `Assets/` → contains all images and planning screenshots
   - `Pages/` → contains subpages like `about.html`, `contact.html`, etc.
